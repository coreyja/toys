# Byte Ideas

One of the main purposes of this repo is to be a collection of programming toys that we can use as the "scene" for different Byte challenges!

This document is a place to jot down how different diffs/commits might make good challenges. We will record here the git commit and/or the PR diff that sparked the idea, since we may keep iterating on the toys so we want to be able to find the version that sparked the idea!


## Ideas

Simple list of ideas with links to the code, and any explanation that we want to record


## Implemented In
